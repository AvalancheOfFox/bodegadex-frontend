## The Bodega Cat Pokedex
Bodega Cat Pokedex is an easy way for New Yorkers to log their encounters with everyone's favorite New York animals, bodega cats. 

## Motivation
This project exists because I was constantly taking pictures of the bodega cats in my neighborhood and I wanted a central place to store these pictures, as well as associate them with the bodega where I took the picture. It also served as a good way to familiarize myself with MapboxGL. 

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

## Code style
Code style is very loose standard at the moment though I may be refactoring to clean up in which case I will likely switch to a stricter typed style like XO.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [MapBoxGL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)
- [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)

## Features
Users can log new cats, new bodegas, and sightings of cats at bodegas. 


## Installation
To run a local version, clone this repository as well as the backend which can be found [here](https://github.com/AvalancheOfFox/bodegadex-backend). Once the code is open in your editor, it's as easy as bundling to make sure your packages are up to date and firing up with `npm start`. Your backend should be running first and React will automatically prompt you to run on a port other than 3000 most likely. 

## Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this project, I am more than happy to accept outside contributions. All I ask is a clear and concise commit history as well as explanatory comments for anything that seems tricky.
